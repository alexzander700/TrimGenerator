# A program that will allow you to generate Trims for the game.



### With the current version, download all the files and run the trimmodifier.py (Parenthesis is an example)

It'll ask you to put in a Material Name, this is what'll show up when you hover your mouse over the item. (Magmatic)

Then it'll ask you for a Material ID, this is the item that you want to use to trigger that trim color. (magma_block)

Finally it'll ask you what colors to use, this'll be for the gradient that is needed. [Currently in RGB format, sorry] (255,127,0) and (255,0,0)

Then it'll generate the Datapack and resource pack. If you want to add more materials, you type in (y) and it'll loop. If you type (clean) it'll delete all generated files.

### If you type anything other than (y) or (clean) it'll finish the program, generating the vanilla materials that the datapack and resourcepack needs, and stopping the program.
